                        Simple phonebook application in Python
Introduction:
A simple phonebook application in Python can be a great way to practice fundamental programming concepts like functions, loops, conditionals, and error handling. 
Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Setup Your Project
   Create a new Python file named `phonebook.py`.
2. Initialize the Phonebook
   At the program's start, an empty dictionary stores contact information. Each name is the key, and the phone number is the value.
3. User Interface
   A loop continuously shows a menu to the user until they choose to exit.
4. Implement CRUD Operations
   You can add, search for, delete, and list all contacts.
